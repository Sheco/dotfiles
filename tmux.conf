# Install powerline https://github.com/powerline/powerline
# This gives you an awesome statusbar, it's a must!
# Debian includes a powerline
# Fedora includes a tmux-powerline package
# You might need special fonts in your computer
# If you don't have root access, or if you don't want to install it
# system-wide, or if it's not available in your repositories,
# you can follow these steps:
# * pick the right client (c, python, shell script)
# * copy that to somewhere in the path
# * copy everything in scripts to somewhere in the path
# * copy powerline to the same directory where the scripts were placed
# * copy config_files/* to ~/.config/powerline/ (so you can edit the config)
