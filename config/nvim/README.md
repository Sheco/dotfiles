# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This is my own LazyVim configuration, to make my vim environment my own personal comfortable home.

I have disabled some things that are enabled by default, this can be found in [lua/plugins/core.lua](lua/plugins/core.lua)

To install this, clone the repo to `$HOME/.config/nvim` and use an updated neovim version, I install the nightly appimage from the [neovim releases page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) and then make it executable and move it somewhere in the path, I normally use $HOME/.local/bin to avoid having to install things systemwide.
