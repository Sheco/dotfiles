# dotfiles
My set of personal configuracion files

Over the years, I've gotten used to reinstalling and setting up my environments, most of the time I try to stick to 
default settings and when I find something that doesn't do what I need it to do, I do some research to set things up 
my own way.

This had some advantages, namely I was forced to stay up to date with newer technologies and practices instead of 
being locked in an old way of doing things.

Unfortunately this is not always efficient and some things are lost in time, which is a shame.

# Installing

To install these files, they can either be copied to the appropriate location, symlinked or included from other files.

For example, the bashrc can be loaded adding this to the preexisting .bashrc, assuming the repo was cloned to ~/dotfiles

```
source ~/dotfiles/bashrc
```
